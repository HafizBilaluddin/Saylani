    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

    <p>Saylani Welfare International Trust is a non-government organization (NGO) focusing primarily on feeding the poor
        and homeless. It was established in May 1999 and is headquartered at Bahdurabad, Karachi, Pakistan.[1]

        It was founded and headed by spiritual and religious scholar Maulana Bashir Farooq Qadri.[2][3] With an
        estimated monthly expenditure of Pakistani Rupees above 30 million, Saylani Trust provides food twice a day to
        more than 30,000 poor people through its 100 centers (generally known as Dastar-Khawan), most of them are
        serving in Karachi.[4][5] The organization distributed CNG rickshaws among the jobless citizens of Karachi in
        April 2011 with the help of members of the Karachi business community.[6]</p>

    <p>Charitable initiatives
        Saylani, since its inception, has worked on both providing needed economic and nutritional help to the needy in
        distress as well as providing means for able-bodied persons to earn a living through innovative solutions to
        "tackle the root causes and effects of poverty of Pakistani citizens." This ranges anywhere from programs
        similar to those provided by Social Security in Western nations to doing area to area and neighborhood to
        neighborhood searches of the needy and providing relief.[7] Notable among these programs are:</p>

    <p>Economic empowerment
        In 2013, in an effort to create economic empowerment via training in Technology, especially Web and Mobile App
        development, Saylani Welfare International Trust began its Saylani Mass IT Training (SMIT) Program under the
        guidance of Zia Ullah Khan,[11] who have previously run successful mass IT programs like “Operation Badar”.[12]
        The goal of SMIT was to create 10,000 well-trained Web and Mobile App developers in emerging programming
        languages like React, Node JS, and Angular JS.[13] The program thus far has trained 4,000 developers
        successfully in fields as varied as Cisco’s CCNA certification, Graphic Design, and Startup Entrepreneurship
        along with the Web and Mobile App development skills to spur economic empowerment and allow its graduates to
        quickly become economically independent.[14]</p>

    <p>Aid to Syrian and Rohingya refugees
        In 2017, Saylani Welfare Trust confirmed that they were providing food aid to Syrian refugees on Turkey's border
        with Syria. The Chief Operating Officer of Saylani, Muhammad Ghazal, said that they are working in partnership
        with the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) to provide aid to Syrian living in refugee
        camps near the border.[15]</p>
